# Dcard Adblock Tweak for ios

## Intro

This is my ios reverse engineering exercise.

I try to learn something and make something in the process to make my life more smooth, so I made this small ios tweak to block(remove) ads on Dcard app :)


## Usage

You can download the **.deb** in the release page to test my adblock for Dcard app.

Or you can compile **DcardAdblock.xm** with your own setup (for newbie like my, you can use [MonkeyDev](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/MonkeyDev)).

## Outro

I'm a newbie, so this tweak may has some bugs.

Feel free to issue and pr!
